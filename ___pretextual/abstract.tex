This work presents a system for classifying diseases in banana plantations using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The main goal is to assist banana producers in the early detection of diseases, such as Sigatoka, which can harm production. The methodology involves collecting and processing images of banana leaves, classifying them as healthy or infected, using the \ac{BananaLSD} dataset. Image processing and deep learning techniques were applied to improve model accuracy. Training and evaluation were conducted with varying parameters, resulting in a more accurate model for disease classification. The work also addresses challenges related to incorporating new diseases, parameter adjustments, and performance optimization, and offers a schedule of future activities for system improvement.
